### Things I learned in this Project:

## REACT
  1. Component Composition (Create-import-Export)
  2. Props
  3. React Hooks:
        - useState
        - useEffect
  4. Fetching Data with Fetch API
  5. Environment Variables
  6. Dynamic Search Functionality
  7. Conditional Rendering

*Note: My primary aim is to learn React and work with backend APIs, so i have not focused on writting styles by self.
